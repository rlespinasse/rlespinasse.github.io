This blog is itself [a project based on hugo](https://github.com/rlespinasse/rlespinasse.github.io) with some github actions to automate it.

In term of automation, I play with **Github Actions**

- to ease the release of a repository : [release-that](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-that),
- to `slug` some environment variables : [github-slug-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-slug),
- to `slug` any variables : [slugify-value](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/slugify-value),
- to expose some git commit data : [git-commit-data-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/git-commit-data),
- to add track capabilities between issues : [issues-tracker-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/issues-tracker).

And also

- [drawio-export-action](https://github.com/rlespinasse/drawio-export-action) : Export Draw.io diagrams within GitHub Actions Workflow,
- [drawio-export](https://github.com/rlespinasse/drawio-export) : Export Draw.io diagrams using docker,
- [drawio-exporter](https://github.com/rlespinasse/drawio-exporter) : Export Draw.io diagrams using command line
- [docker-drawio-desktop-headless](https://github.com/rlespinasse/docker-drawio-desktop-headless) : Docker image to serve Draw.io Desktop in a headless version.

In the `rust` world,

- **W**hat **I** **N**eed **T**o **S**ee ([wints](https://github.com/rlespinasse/wints)), a fuzzy term-based URLs opener,
- [drawio-exporter](https://github.com/rlespinasse/drawio-exporter) to export Draw.io diagrams using command line.

In the `golang` world,

- [hoff](https://github.com/rlespinasse/hoff) serve as an engine to run workflows composed of high order functions,
- You can manipulate some bytes with [byteslice](https://github.com/rlespinasse/byteslice).

Because I love to play with `bash` scripts, [michel](https://github.com/rlespinasse/michel) help to structure all yours scripts.
> Try **michel** who serve as GitHub template.

And all my current and past projects are available on [https://github.com/rlespinasse](https://github.com/rlespinasse).
