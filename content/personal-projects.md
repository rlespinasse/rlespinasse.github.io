This blog is itself [a project based on hugo](https://github.com/rlespinasse/rlespinasse.github.io) with some github actions to automate it.

In term of automation, I play with **Github Actions**

- to `slug` some environment variables : [Github Slug Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-slug).
- to add track capabilities between issues : [Issues Tracker Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/issues-tracker).

In `golang`:

- [hoff](https://github.com/rlespinasse/hoff) serve as an engine to run workflows composed of high order functions,
- You can manipulate some bytes with [byteslice](https://github.com/rlespinasse/byteslice).

Because I love to play with `bash` scripts, [michel](https://github.com/rlespinasse/michel) help to structure all your scripts.
Try **michel** who serve as GitHub template.
