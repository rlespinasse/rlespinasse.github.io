This blog is itself [a project based on hugo](https://github.com/rlespinasse/rlespinasse.github.io) with some github actions to automate it.

In term of automation, I play with **Github Actions** and made a small one to `slug` some environment variables : [Github Slug Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-slug).

In `golang`:

* [hoff](https://github.com/rlespinasse/hoff) serve as an engine to run workflows composed of high order functions,
* You can manipulate some bytes with [byteslice](https://github.com/rlespinasse/byteslice).

Because I love to play with `bash` scripts, [michel](https://github.com/rlespinasse/michel) help to structure all your scripts.
Try **michel** who serve as GitHub template.

Around Google Cloud Platform, a small project linked the winter break (no physical contact to say hello) I take every year to avoid sickness during the cold season: 

> [Is It The Winter Break Yet?](https://github.com/rlespinasse/IsItTheWinterBreakYet).
