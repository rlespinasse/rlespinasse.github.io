## Opensource

This blog is itself [a project based on hugo](https://github.com/rlespinasse/rlespinasse.github.io) with some github actions to automate it.

In term of automation, I play with **Github Actions**

* to ease the release of a repository : [release-that](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-that),
* to `slug` some environment variables : [github-slug-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-slug),
* to `slug` any variable : [slugify-value](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/slugify-value),
* to `short` some git references : [shortify-git-revision](https://github.com/rlespinasse/shortify-git-revision),
* to expose some git commit data : [git-commit-data-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/git-commit-data),
* to add track capabilities between issues : [issues-tracker-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/issues-tracker) (**archived**).

And also

* [drawio-export-action](https://github.com/rlespinasse/drawio-export-action) : Export Draw.io diagrams within GitHub Actions Workflow,
* [drawio-export](https://github.com/rlespinasse/drawio-export) : Export Draw.io diagrams using docker,
* [drawio-exporter](https://github.com/rlespinasse/drawio-exporter) : Export Draw.io diagrams using command line,
* [docker-drawio-desktop-headless](https://github.com/rlespinasse/docker-drawio-desktop-headless) : Docker image to serve Draw.io Desktop in a headless version,
  * Or its predecessor [drawio-cli](https://github.com/rlespinasse/drawio-cli) (**archived**).

In the `rust` world,

* **W**hat **I** **N**eed **T**o **S**ee ([wints](https://github.com/rlespinasse/wints)), a fuzzy term-based URLs opener,
* [drawio-exporter](https://github.com/rlespinasse/drawio-exporter) to export Draw.io diagrams using command line.

In the `golang` world,

* [hoff](https://github.com/rlespinasse/hoff) serve as an engine to run workflows composed of high order functions (**archived**),
* You can manipulate some bytes with [byteslice](https://github.com/rlespinasse/byteslice) (**archived**).

Because I love to play with `bash` scripts, [michel](https://github.com/rlespinasse/michel) help to structure all yours scripts (**archived**).
> Try **michel** who serve as GitHub template.

And all my current and past projects are available on [https://github.com/rlespinasse](https://github.com/rlespinasse).

> You can also `sponsor me` on GitHub if you want.
