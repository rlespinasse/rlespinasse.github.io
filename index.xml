In term of automation, I play with Github Actions
to ease the release of a repository : release-that, to slug some environment variables : github-slug-action, to slug any variables : slugify-value, to expose some git commit data : git-commit-data-action, to add track capabilities between issues : issues-tracker-action. And also
drawio-export-action : Export Draw.</description></item><item><title>Hacktoberfest 2020 Report | github-slug-action Maintainer</title><link>https://www.romainlespinasse.dev/posts/hacktobertfest2020-slug/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 11:42:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.romainlespinasse.dev/posts/hacktobertfest2020-slug/</guid><description>This post have been published first on dev.to.
Some projects ideas can start from a colleague tweet. This idea behind github-slug-action is one of them (tweet in French).
From this SLUG variable need, I start to develop my first GitHub Action. Using docker-based container and some bash script with sed or cut, I create the first version of this action quickly.
master end-of-life After sometimes, github-slug-action start to be used by multiples projects and some enhancements have been asked.</description></item><item><title>Hacktoberfest 2020 Report | drawio-cli and drawio-export Maintainer</title><link>https://www.romainlespinasse.dev/posts/hacktobertfest2020-drawio/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 10:42:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.romainlespinasse.dev/posts/hacktobertfest2020-drawio/</guid><description>This post have been published first on dev.to.
Earlier this year, I want to be able to automatically export diagrams from a drawio file. This need lead to the creation of 2 new open-sources projects :
The drawio-cli project is responsible to generate a docker image with a raw cli of drawio (thanks drawio-desktop) for that.
The drawio-export project use the drawio-cli project to enhance initial export capabilities.</description></item><item><title>Hacktoberfest 2020 Report | Lessons learned as Maintainer</title><link>https://www.romainlespinasse.dev/posts/hacktobertfest2020-maintainer/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Nov 2020 10:42:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.romainlespinasse.dev/posts/hacktobertfest2020-maintainer/</guid><description>This post have been published first on dev.to.
as Creator Project ideas come from everywhere, don&amp;rsquo;t limit yourself and create a public repository even when you may be the only user.
Don&amp;rsquo;t be perfect from the start, you can improve your project during its lifetime.
You can choose any name for your project, sometimes a descriptive name, sometimes a play of words.</description></item><item><title>Motto | Everybody has a testing environment</title><link>https://www.romainlespinasse.dev/posts/motto-testing-environment/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Sep 2020 10:42:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.romainlespinasse.dev/posts/motto-testing-environment/</guid><description>This post have been published first on dev.to.
Motto Everybody has a testing environment. Some people are lucky enough enough to have a totally separate environment to run production in.
